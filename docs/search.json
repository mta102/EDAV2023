    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nVaccine hesitance is where individuals express reluctance or refusal to receive vaccines despite the widespread availability of vaccination services. It has been a longstanding issue in public health globally, despite global public healthcare messaging. Some causes of vaccine hesitance include mistrust in healthcare systems, concerns about vaccine safety or efficacy, religious or cultural beliefs, and misinformation (https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/vaccine-hesitancy-reasons.html, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9659512/ ).\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitance was an obstacle in the global response to the virus. The rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines simultaneously fueled scientific acclaim and concerns about their safety and long-term effects. Misinformation spread rapidly through social media and other channels, contributing to skepticism about the vaccines’ efficacy and safety. These uncertainties, coupled with existing mistrust in government health agencies and pharmaceutical companies, created a fertile ground for vaccine hesitance to take root.\nThe consequences of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were profound. It slowed efforts to achieve widespread immunity, allowing the virus to persist and mutate, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants. This prolonged the duration and severity of the pandemic, resulting in increased illness, death, and strain on healthcare systems worldwide, alongside exacerbating the economic and social impacts of the pandemic (https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-022-00075-x ).\nThe challenges posed by vaccine hesitance during the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of addressing this issue as an integral part of future public health strategies. To that end, we propose to: •Study which segments of the population exhibited greatest covid vaccine hesitancy following the deployment of mass vaccinations in the US in early 2021 •Analyse which segments showed the greatest reduction in covid vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023 •Propose high-level recommendations for segments of the population that need further public health interventions"

The lowest values that can be seen are 0.1%.\nMoreover, within each group and indicator containing at least one NA, the sum of response rates across the non-NA values adds up to 100%.\n\nBased on the findings above, we can safely conclude that the NAs in our dataset represent true 0% response rates. As such, we will impute NAs with 0s for our analysis purposes."

    "section": "2.1 2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 2.1 Technical Description\n\n2.1.1 Identify one or more data sources:\nThe data source which we will use for our study is the CDC’s National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM). It provides information on COVID-19 vaccination status and intent, segmented by geography, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and other characteristics. The data can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/covidvaxview/interactive/adults.html\n\n\n2.1.2 How the data are collected and by whom:\nThe data was collected by the CDC through a series of telephone interviews conducted between April 2021 and June 2023 (latest sample available). Each week, the CDC surveyed between 7,500 to 20,000 US adults aged 18 years and above using a random-digit-dialed sample of cell telephone numbers. These samples were stratified by state, the District of Columbia, and five local jurisdictions (Bexar County, TX; Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; New York City, NY; and Philadelphia County, PA). During some survey periods, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico were included as well.\nTo correct any imbalances or biases in the sample that might arise due to the survey design or data collection methods, the CDC applied weights to the proportion of the sampled individuals giving a particular response in the survey.\n\n\n2.1.3 Format of the data:\nThe data is presented as a CSV file in a “pivot longer” format that is downloadable from the CDC’s website provided above. The exact format can be seen without exporting the data using the following link: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Immunization-Survey-Adult-COVID-Module-NI/udsf-9v7b\nThe first four columns (Geography Type, Geography, Group Name, and Group Category) are used to characterize the segments of individuals who were surveyed, where any given Geography may contain multiple Group Names and Group Categories. For example, the Geographies “Alabama” and “New York” will each have multiple Group Names, such as “Age by race/ethnicity” or “Pregnancy status (females age 18 – 49 years)”.\nThe next two columns in the dataset, Indicator Name and Indicator Category, specify the vaccination status/intent variables being analyzed. Each Indicator Name is comprised of several Indicator Categories. For instance, the Indicator Name “Vaccination uptake and intention” has four possible responses such as “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated” or “Definitely will get vaccinated”.\nIn addition to the combinations of geographies, participant groups, and survey questions/answers, the data is further subdivided by time period and duration of data collection, which can either be weekly or monthly.\nFor all the permutations mentioned above, the response rates/proportions and their corresponding confidence intervals and sample sizes are recorded in the columns Estimate (%), 95% CI (%), and Sample Size, respectively.\nA complete column-by-column description of all attributes in the dataset is available in the “Columns in This Dataset” section of the page linked below: list https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Immunization-Survey-Adult-COVID-Module-NI/udsf-9v7b\nGiven that the participant demographics and combinations of survey questions and answers have been pivoted, each “row” of data represents a single observation for each segment/demographic.\n\n\n2.1.4 Frequency of updates:\nThe data is updated weekly, with the first samples of data having been collected the week of Apr 22 – May 1 2021 and the latest samples corresponding to the week of June 25 – June 30 2023. The CDC also aggregates its weekly estimates to determine monthly estimates.\n\n\n2.1.5 Dimensions:\nThe data contains 5.08M rows x 13 columns.\n\n\n2.1.6 Other relevant information:\nThe dataset includes the following additional information, which we will not be studying, as it does not directly address the question of vaccine hesitance: - Vaccination coverage - Bivalent booster update & intention\n\n\n2.1.7 Potential issues/concerns with the data:\nThrough data exploration and reviews of the data source documentation, we identified the following potential concerns:\n\nAll responses are self-reported & random dialed, making the data quality susceptible to misreporting by respondents.\nDue to the random sampling performed, the individuals being interviewed will differ from one period of time to another. While this limits our ability to track changes in perspective from the same people over time, it is likely not going to be an issue since we are concerned with population level statistics rather than individual statistics.\nThe sample size in the dataset varies by demographic subgroup. Ideally, it would be stratified, but this is likely not possible due to the random-dialed survey design (i.e. the CDC cannot target phone calls to specific demographics). This is likely accounted for by the CDC’s estimate weighting technique.\nThere appear to be rounding errors in the response rate estimates. For any given combination of geography, participant group, question, and time period, the sum of proportions do not exactly equal 100%. This is due to the response rates in the Estimate (%) column being rounded to just one decimal point. As a result, some sub-samples sum up to 101% across all the response options specified in the Indicator Category.\nThe data contains NAs in the Estimate (%) column. According to the data source documentations, NAs should only be present in smaller sub-samples (&lt;30) for which the data was intentionally suppressed. However, our data exploration revealed that groups with larger sample sizes, even surpassing 10,000, contained NAs in the Estimate (%) column. Conversely, some groups with samples less than 30 do not have NA response rate values. A related concern is that the Suppression Flag (1 = suppressed) should only be set to 1 where sample sizes were smaller than 30; however, we see Suppression values of 1 for groups of larger sizes. In some instances, the Estimate (%) may not be NA, yet the Suppression Flag was still set to 1.\n\n\n\n2.1.8 How to import the data:\n\nSelect Download Data Table from the link provided at the beginning of the technical description.\nOn the following page, select Export from the top right corner next to the Actions button.\nKeep the default Export Format as CSV and click Download.\nOnce downloaded, import the dataset into RStudio for analysis. The function fread() from the data.table library is recommended to reduce load time."

    "text": "2.2 2.2 Research plan\n\n2.2.1 Explain in detail how your data will enable you to answer your research questions from the introduction.\nThe dataset chosen provides a number of interesting factors to be examined in the context of vaccine hesitance. Below, we have outlined the fields we plan to leverage in order to explore potential relationships between our dependent variable - vaccine hesitance response rates - and various independent variables such as geography, age, and ethnicity.\nDependent Variable(s)\nThe data contains the following dependent variables of interest to our study, which can be identified by filtering our starting-point table for Indicator Name = “Vaccine uptake and intention”: - Estimate (%) (i.e., response rate) for Indicator Category = “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated” - Estimate (%) for Indicator Category = “Probably will not get vaccinated or unsure” - Estimate (%) for Indicator Category = “Definitely will get vaccinated” - Estimate (%) for Indicator Category = “Vaccinated (&gt;=1 dose)”\nWhere applicable, we can combine the dependent variables above into the following two options:\n\nHesitant: Indicator Category = “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated”\nNot hesitant or unsure: all other values in the ‘Indicator Category’\n\nIndependent variables\nThe correlation between the hesitance and the following independent variables (as defined by the column “Group Name”) will be studied initially nationally (as defined by the column “Geography”), but any geographical disparities may be highlighted on a case by case basis:\nDemographics - Gender - Age - Race\n- Age & race - Sexual orientation - Gender identity - Rural/urban - Birth - Interview language - Poverty - Insurance - SVI - Political leaning\nHealth condition - Previous vaccination status - Comorbidity - Disability - Pregnancy - Past covid-19 contraction - Reaction to previous dose of vaccine\n“Thinking & feeling” - Concern about getting disease - Vaccine safety concerns - “Importance” of vaccine\nSocial pressure - Recommended by healthcare providers - Family & friends’ vaccination status - Employer vaccine mandate\nLogistics - Difficulty in accessing vaccine (general “difficulty”, distance to site, convenience, uncertainty about eligibility, cost, difficulty in getting an appointment)\nTime window We would also like to study changes in hesitance at particular points in time and changes over a large period of time (2 years, from Apr/May 2021 to Jun 2023). As such, we we will use the Time Period field as another variable for this analysis. While the data is broken down between weekly and monthly samples, we will be focusing on monthly data for our study. This is because we do not expect significant changes in hesitance on a weekly basis, and attempting to compare weekly data could be subject to sampling error due to the random-dialed study design.\n\n\n2.2.2 Approach:\nOur analysis approach can be broken down into the following key activities:\n\n2.2.2.1 Part 1: Study which segments of the population exhibited greatest covid vaccine hesitancy following the deployment of mass vaccinations in the US in early 2021.\nThis process will consist of the following steps:\n\nWriting R-code to auto rank every possible segment’s hesitance by statistical significance (i.e. using p-values and test-statistics from Chi-sq tests) at a point in time specified below.\nBuilding visuals of the 10 segments with the strongest association to vaccine hesitance to draw additional insights. For this step, we are considering using the following graph types: (x / indpt vars are cat: y / dep vars are numerical (% or n stating “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated”)\nBars / stacked bars\nMosaic plots\nSpatial heatmaps\nThe snapshot in time we will be using to measure associations will comprise of the first three monthly periods of data available, where the average proportion of responses corresponding to vaccine hesitance was ~18%. To combine the three monthly periods, we will create a weighted average of the survey responses. For instance, if vaccine hesitance rates for a particular group were 20 out 100 (20%) in month 1, 20/150 (13%) in month 2, and 10/90 (11%) in month 3, the weighted average hesitance rate for that group would be 50/340 (14.7%).\n\nThe rationale for choosing the first three monthly periods of data is due to the prevalence and relative stability of hesitance during that time frame. Below, we will visualize vaccine hesitance over time to illustrate this.\n\n2.2.2.1.1 Import Libraries\n\n\nCode\n# install.packages(\"data.table\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1.2 Import dataset\n\n\nCode\n# Load dataset\ncovid &lt;- fread(\"../covid_dataset/covid.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.1.3 Plot vaccine hesitance over time\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for the vaccination uptake and intent indicator\n# Filter for responses corresponding to vaccine hesitancy\n# Include all adults 18+\n# Set time period to monthly (excluding weekly samples) and filter for nationwide samples\nvacc_intention_time &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Indicator Name` == 'Vaccination uptake and intention') |&gt;\n  filter(`Indicator Category` == 'Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated') |&gt;\n  filter(`Group Name` == 'All adults 18+') |&gt;\n  filter(`Time Type` == 'Monthly') |&gt;\n  filter(Geography == 'National') |&gt;\n  arrange(`Geography Type`, Geography, `Time Period`)\n\n# Derive month of data collection\nvacc_intention_time &lt;- vacc_intention_time |&gt;\n  mutate(month_split = paste0(str_split(`Time Period`, \"-\",\n                                        simplify = TRUE)[, 2],\n         \", \", Year),\n         month = mdy(month_split))\n\n# Plot hesitancy over time\nggplot(vacc_intention_time, aes(x = month, y = `Estimate (%)`,\n                                color = `Indicator Category`)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"U.S. Vaccination Response Rates Over Time\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Response Rate (%)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Indicator Category:\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Part 2: Analyze which segments showed the greatest reduction in covid vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023\nWe will analyse which segments showed the greatest reduction in COVID vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023. To perform this step, we will leverage several visuals that can provide insights into trends of hesitancy over time: - Cleveland dot plot - plot or annual snapshot of change in variable(s) of interest over time - Geographic heatmap (colours = changes) - Bar chart\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Part 3: Based on the findings above, we will propose high-level recommendations for segments of the population that need further public health interventions."
