    "text": "1 Introduction\nVaccine hesitance is where individuals express reluctance or refusal to receive vaccines despite the widespread availability of vaccination services. It has been a longstanding issue in public health globally, despite global public healthcare messaging. Some causes of vaccine hesitance include mistrust in healthcare systems, concerns about vaccine safety or efficacy, religious or cultural beliefs, and misinformation, as mentioned in articles by the American Academy of Family Physicians (linked here) and the NIH (linked here).\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitance was an obstacle in the global response to the virus. The rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines simultaneously fueled scientific acclaim and concerns about their safety and long-term effects. Misinformation spread rapidly through social media and other channels, contributing to skepticism about the vaccines’ efficacy and safety. These uncertainties, coupled with existing mistrust in government health agencies and pharmaceutical companies, created a fertile ground for vaccine hesitance to take root.\nThe consequences of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance were profound. It slowed efforts to achieve widespread immunity, allowing the virus to persist and mutate, leading to the emergence of more transmissible variants. This prolonged the duration and severity of the pandemic, resulting in increased illness, death, and strain on healthcare systems worldwide, alongside exacerbating the economic and social impacts of the pandemic (source: Communications Medicine article linked here).\nThe challenges posed by vaccine hesitance during the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of addressing this issue as an integral part of future public health strategies. To that end, we propose to:\n\nStudy which segments of the population exhibited greatest COVID vaccine hesitancy following the deployment of mass vaccinations in the US in early 2021.\nAnalyze which segments showed the greatest reduction in COVID vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023.\nPropose high-level recommendations for segments of the population that need further public health interventions."

    "section": "2.1 Technical Description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n\n2.1.1 Data source selected:\nThe data source which we will use for our study is the CDC’s National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM). It provides information on COVID-19 vaccination status and intent, segmented by geography, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and other characteristics. The data can be found here\n\n\n2.1.2 How the data was collected and by whom:\nThe data was collected by the CDC through a series of telephone interviews conducted between April 2021 and June 2023 (latest sample available). Each week, the CDC surveyed between 7,500 to 20,000 US adults aged 18 years and above using a random-digit-dialed sample of cell telephone numbers. These samples were stratified by state, the District of Columbia, and five local jurisdictions (Bexar County, TX; Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; New York City, NY; and Philadelphia County, PA). During some survey periods, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico were included as well.\nTo correct any imbalances or biases in the sample that might arise due to the survey design or data collection methods, the CDC applied weights to the proportion of the sampled individuals giving a particular response in the survey.\n\n\n2.1.3 Format of the data:\nThe data is presented as a CSV file in a “pivot longer” format that is downloadable from the CDC’s website provided above. The exact format can be seen without exporting the data using the following link: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Immunization-Survey-Adult-COVID-Module-NI/udsf-9v7b\nThe first four columns (Geography Type, Geography, Group Name, and Group Category) are used to characterize the segments of individuals who were surveyed, where any given Geography may contain multiple Group Names and Group Categories. For example, the Geographies “Alabama” and “New York” will each have multiple Group Names, such as “Age by race/ethnicity” or “Pregnancy status (females age 18 – 49 years)”.\nThe next two columns in the dataset, Indicator Name and Indicator Category, specify the vaccination status/intent variables being analyzed. Each Indicator Name is comprised of several Indicator Categories. For instance, the Indicator Name “Vaccination uptake and intention” has four possible responses such as “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated” or “Definitely will get vaccinated”.\nIn addition to the combinations of geographies, participant groups, and survey questions/answers, the data is further subdivided by time period and duration of data collection, which can either be weekly or monthly.\nFor all the permutations mentioned above, the response rates/proportions and their corresponding confidence intervals and sample sizes are recorded in the columns Estimate (%), 95% CI (%), and Sample Size, respectively.\nA complete column-by-column description of all attributes in the dataset is available in the “Columns in This Dataset” section of the page linked below: list https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/National-Immunization-Survey-Adult-COVID-Module-NI/udsf-9v7b\nGiven that the participant demographics and combinations of survey questions and answers have been pivoted, each “row” of data represents a single observation for each segment/demographic.\n\n\n2.1.4 Frequency of updates:\nThe data is updated weekly, with the first samples of data having been collected the week of Apr 22 – May 1 2021 and the latest samples corresponding to the week of June 25 – June 30 2023. The CDC also aggregates its weekly estimates to determine monthly estimates.\n\n\n2.1.5 Dataset dimensions:\nThe data contains 5.08M rows x 13 columns.\n\n\n2.1.6 Other relevant information:\nThe dataset includes the following additional information, which we will not be studying, as it does not directly address the question of vaccine hesitance: - Vaccination coverage - Bivalent booster update & intention\n\n\n2.1.7 Potential issues/concerns with the data:\nThrough data exploration and reviews of the data source documentation, we identified the following potential concerns:\n\nAll responses are self-reported & random dialed, making the data quality susceptible to misreporting by respondents.\nDue to the random sampling performed, the individuals being interviewed will differ from one period of time to another. While this limits our ability to track changes in perspective from the same people over time, it is likely not going to be an issue since we are concerned with population level statistics rather than individual statistics.\nThe sample size in the dataset varies by demographic subgroup. Ideally, it would be stratified, but this is likely not possible due to the random-dialed survey design (i.e. the CDC cannot target phone calls to specific demographics). This is likely accounted for by the CDC’s estimate weighting technique.\nThere appear to be rounding errors in the response rate estimates. For any given combination of geography, participant group, question, and time period, the sum of proportions do not exactly equal 100%. This is due to the response rates in the Estimate (%) column being rounded to just one decimal point. As a result, some sub-samples sum up to 101% across all the response options specified in the Indicator Category.\nThe data contains NAs in the Estimate (%) column. According to the data source documentations, NAs should only be present in smaller sub-samples (&lt;30) for which the data was intentionally suppressed. However, our data exploration revealed that groups with larger sample sizes, even surpassing 10,000, contained NAs in the Estimate (%) column. Conversely, some groups with samples less than 30 do not have NA response rate values. A related concern is that the Suppression Flag (1 = suppressed) should only be set to 1 where sample sizes were smaller than 30; however, we see Suppression values of 1 for groups of larger sizes. In some instances, the Estimate (%) may not be NA, yet the Suppression Flag was still set to 1.\n\n\n\n2.1.8 How to import the data:\n\nSelect Download Data Table from the link provided at the beginning of the technical description.\nOn the following page, select Export from the top right corner next to the Actions button.\nKeep the default Export Format as CSV and click Download.\nOnce downloaded, import the dataset into RStudio for analysis. The function fread() from the data.table library is recommended to reduce load time."

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\n\n2.2.1 How the data can be used for our research:\nThe dataset chosen provides a number of interesting factors to be examined in the context of vaccine hesitance. Below, we have outlined the fields we plan to leverage in order to explore potential relationships between our dependent variable - vaccine hesitance response rates - and various independent variables such as geography, age, and ethnicity.\nDependent Variable(s)\nThe data contains the following dependent variables of interest to our study, which can be identified by filtering our starting-point table for Indicator Name = “Vaccine uptake and intention”:\n\nEstimate (%) (i.e., response rate) for Indicator Category = “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated”\nEstimate (%) for Indicator Category = “Probably will not get vaccinated or unsure”\nEstimate (%) for Indicator Category = “Definitely will get vaccinated”\nEstimate (%) for Indicator Category = “Vaccinated (&gt;=1 dose)”\n\nFor analysis purposes, we combined the vaccine uptake/intention responses into two categories, Hesitant and Not Hesitant, as outlined below. Our focus is to explore factors that relate to Hesitant responses.\n\nHesitant: Indicator Category = “Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated”\nNot hesitant or unsure: all other values in the ‘Indicator Category’\n\nIndependent variables\nThe disparities in vaccine hesitance will be studied initially by geography (as defined by the “Geography” column in our dataset) and then by population segment (specified in the “Group Name” and “Group Category” columns) on a case by case basis. Below are examples of population characteristics we will be analyzing while looking for drivers of vaccine hesitance:\nGeneral Demographics:\n\nGender\nAge\nRace\nAge & race\nSexual orientation\nGender identity\nRural/urban\nBirth\nInterview language\nPoverty\nInsurance\nSocial vulnerability index (SVI)\nPolitical leaning\n\nHealth Condition-Specific\n\nPrevious vaccination status\nComorbidity\nDisability\nPregnancy\nPast covid-19 contraction\nReaction to previous dose of vaccine\n\n“Thinking & feeling”\n\nConcern about getting disease\nVaccine safety concerns\n“Importance” of vaccine\n\nSocial Pressure-Related Demographics\n\nRecommended by healthcare providers\nFamily & friends’ vaccination status\nEmployer vaccine mandate\n\nLogistics\n\nDifficulty in accessing vaccine (general “difficulty”, distance to site, convenience, uncertainty about eligibility, cost, difficulty in getting an appointment)\n\nTime window\nWe would like to study changes in hesitance at particular points in time and changes over a large period of time (2 years, from Apr/May 2021 to Jun 2023). As such, we we will use the Time Period field as another variable for this analysis. While the data is broken down between weekly and monthly samples, we will be focusing on monthly data for our study. This is because we do not expect significant changes in hesitance on a weekly basis, and attempting to compare weekly data could be subject to sampling error due to the random-dialed study design.\n\n\n2.2.2 Approach:\nOur analysis approach can be broken down into the following key activities:\n\n2.2.2.1 Part 1: Study which segments of the population exhibited greatest covid vaccine hesitancy following the deployment of mass vaccinations in the US in early 2021.\nThis process will consist of the following steps:\n\nVisualizing geographic disparities in vaccine hesitance via spatial heatmaps.\nPerforming Chi-Square tests to identify the types of population demographics that have an association with vaccine hesitance.\nDeveloping supporting graphs that enable us to explore how vaccine hesitance varies by population segment and draw additional insights. For this step, we will leverage a variety of graph types such as parallel coordinates plots, bar charts, mosaic plots, and scatterplots.\n\nThe snapshot in time we will be using to analyze hesitancy will comprise of the first three monthly periods of data available, where the average proportion of responses corresponding to vaccine hesitance was ~18%. To combine the three monthly periods, we will create a weighted average of the survey responses. For instance, if vaccine hesitance rates for a particular group were 20 out 100 (20%) in month 1, 20/150 (13%) in month 2, and 10/90 (11%) in month 3, the weighted average hesitance rate for that group would be 50/340 (14.7%).\nThe rationale for choosing the first three monthly periods of data is due to the prevalence and relative stability of hesitance during that time frame. Below, we will visualize vaccine hesitance over time to illustrate this.\n\n\nCode\n#Plot vaccine hesitance over time\n\n# Import libraries\n# install.packages(\"data.table\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Load dataset\ncovid &lt;- fread(\"../covid_dataset/covid.csv\")\n\n\n# Filter for the vaccination uptake and intent indicator\n# Filter for responses corresponding to vaccine hesitancy\n# Include all adults 18+\n# Set time period to monthly (excluding weekly samples) and filter for nationwide samples\nvacc_intention_time &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Indicator Name` == 'Vaccination uptake and intention') |&gt;\n  filter(`Indicator Category` == 'Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated') |&gt;\n  filter(`Group Name` == 'All adults 18+') |&gt;\n  filter(`Time Type` == 'Monthly') |&gt;\n  filter(Geography == 'National') |&gt;\n  arrange(`Geography Type`, Geography, `Time Period`)\n\n# Derive month of data collection\nvacc_intention_time &lt;- vacc_intention_time |&gt;\n  mutate(month_split = paste0(str_split(`Time Period`, \"-\",\n                                        simplify = TRUE)[, 2],\n         \", \", Year),\n         month = mdy(month_split))\n\n# Plot hesitancy over time\nggplot(vacc_intention_time, aes(x = month, y = `Estimate (%)`,\n                                color = `Indicator Category`)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"U.S. Vaccination Response Rates Over Time\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Response Rate (%)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Indicator Category:\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Part 2: Analyze which segments showed the greatest reduction in covid vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023\nFollowing Part 1, will research which segments showed the greatest reduction in COVID vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023. To perform this step, we will leverage several visuals that can provide insights into trends of hesitancy over time:\n\nCleveland dot plots\nSpatial heatmaps\nBar charts\n\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Part 3: Based on the findings above, we will propose high-level recommendations for segments of the population that need further public health interventions."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nBefore moving forward with our analysis approach, we conducted an investigation into possible missing data in our dataset. Our exploration of NAs in the dataset revealed the following findings:\n\nOur dataset does contain NAs; however, they are isolated to the Estimate (%) column in our dataset, as shown below.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Flag whether a data point is NA\nmissing_vals_matrix &lt;- is.na(as.data.frame(covid))\n\n# Count NAs per column\nmissing_col_count &lt;- colSums(missing_vals_matrix)\n\n# Create a data frame with column names and NA counts\nmissing_vals_count_df &lt;- data.frame(Column = names(missing_col_count),\n                     NA_Count = missing_col_count)\n\n# Plot NA counts per column\n# All NAs are in the Estimate (%) column\nggplot(missing_vals_count_df,\n       aes(x = NA_Count, y = reorder(Column, NA_Count))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Values by Column\",\n       x = \"Count of NAs\",\n       y = \"Dataset Attributes\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRows of data that have an NA hesitance rate still show the confidence interval for the true hesitance rate. The confidence intervals across these rows show hesitance rates close to 0%, suggesting that the NAs we are seeing should correspond to a hesitance rate of 0%.\n\n\n\nCode\n# To understand the NAs further, we made 3 observations which strongly indicates NA are in fact zero:\n\n# Observation 1: All NAs have a valid 95% confidence interval of between 0-0 to 0-0.3.\n\ncovid |&gt; filter(is.na(`Estimate (%)`)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = `95% CI (%)`)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), color = \"black\", fill = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"Confidence Intervals (CI) for NA Values\",\n       x = \"95% CI for NA Values\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Total NA Values\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust=0.5))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is further supported by another finding: there are 0 rows in the entire dataset showing a true 0% response rate. The lowest values that can be seen are 0.1%.\n\n\n\nCode\n# To understand the NAs further, we made 3 observations which strongly indicates NA are in fact zero:\n\n# Observation 2: Estimate (%) is rounded to 1 decimal point, and the lowest possible non-NA value is 0.1\ncovid |&gt;\n  group_by(`Estimate (%)`) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\n  filter(`Estimate (%)` &lt;= 0.2 | is.na(`Estimate (%)`)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(`Estimate (%)`))\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  `Estimate (%)` count\n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1            0.2 25242\n2            0.1 30264\n3           NA   31788\n\n\n\nMoreover, within each group and indicator containing at least one NA, the sum of response rates across the non-NA values adds up to 100%.

    "text": "3.1 Part 1: Study which segments of the population exhibited greatest COVID vaccine hesitancy following the deployment of mass vaccinations in the US in early 2021.\nThe national average COVID hesitance rate reported during the first quarter of the data collection period (April - July 2021) was ~18%. In other words, 18% of those surveyed after the mass deployment of vaccinations responded that they would probably or definitely not get vaccinated. In Part 1, we will break down this percentage across U.S. geographies, identifying the states with the highest and lowest hesitancy rates. We will then analyze the types of population demographics (e.g., age, vaccination history, ethnicity, etc.) that had a strong association with COVID vaccine hesitancy.\nOur analysis of variations in vaccine hesitance begins by comparing hesitancy across states during the April-July 21’ timeframe. As illustrated in the map below, vaccine hesitance varied significantly by geography. States such as Hawaii, New York, and Vermont exhibited the lowest hesitance, while other states like Wyoming, North Dakota, and West Virginia exhibited the highest hesitance. It is worth noting that there are clusters of high hesitance, namely the South East and Northern Mountain West regions, whereas low hesitance was more prominent in the North East and South West regions.\n\n\nCode\n# Import libraries\n\n# install.packages(\"choroplethr\")\n# install.packages(\"RColorBrewer\")\n# install.packages(\"GGally\")\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\n# install.packages(\"choroplethrMaps\")\n# devtools::install_github(\"timelyportfolio/parcoords\")\n# install.packages(\"ggpmisc\")\n\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(vcd)\nlibrary(choroplethrMaps)\nlibrary(GGally)\nlibrary(parcoords)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(choroplethr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Import starting dataset and filter for vaccine hesitance indicator and monthly samples\n\n\n# Load vaccine hesitancy data\ncovid &lt;- fread(\"../covid_dataset/covid.csv\")\n\n# Filter for Monthly sample period and vaccine hesitance responses\ncovid_hes &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Time Type` == \"Monthly\",\n         `Indicator Category` == \"Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated\")\n\n# Prep data for analysis.

Before diving into each state further, we first identified the population segments with relatively higher nationwide vaccine hesitance rates from April-July 2021.

For instance, “Vaccine.Imprtnt - A little_not at all” represents individuals who do not believe vaccines are essential to healthcare, whereas “Fr.Fam.Vaccd - No_some” corresponds to individuals who responded “No or some” to whether their friends and/or family are vaccinated. A noteworthy observation is that political views may have influenced vaccine hesitancy, evidenced by a high hesitance rate among Republican survey participants.\nTo investigate how population-specific hesitance varies by state, we focused on the 10 most and 10 least hesitant states and generated two corresponding parallel coordinate plots, where elements on the x-axis represent some of the most hesitant population segments.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate hesitance over three months in 2021 by state and population segment\n# Clean state column\nstate_group_analysis &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Year` == 2021,\n         `Time Period` %in% periods_to_combine_2021,\n         `Geography Type` == \"Jurisdictional Estimates\",\n         `Indicator Category` == \"Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated\",\n         !grepl(\"-\", Geography)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_hesitant = round(`Estimate (%)`/100 * `Sample Size`, 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Geography, `Group Name`, `Group Category`) |&gt;\n  summarise(`Sample Size` = sum(`Sample Size`),\n            n_hesitant = sum(n_hesitant)) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Estimate (%)` = n_hesitant / `Sample Size` * 100,\n         `Time Period` = \"2021 analysis period\",\n         Year = 2021) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n\n# Shorten group names\nstate_group_analysis &lt;- state_group_analysis |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(`Group Name`), ~recode(., !!!group_name_shortening))\n\nstate_group_analysis &lt;- state_group_analysis |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(`Group Category`), ~recode(., !!!group_cat_shortening))\n\nstate_group_analysis &lt;- state_group_analysis |&gt; mutate(concat = paste(`Group Name`, `Group Category`, sep = \" - \"))\n\nstate_group_analysis$concat_wrap &lt;- str_wrap(state_group_analysis$concat, width = 10)\n\n\n# Filter groups for top most hesitant\n# Pivot wider to convert row-level categories to columns containing hesitancy rates\nstate_group_analysis_pivot &lt;- state_group_analysis |&gt;\n  filter(concat %in% top_10_highest_hesitance_cat_list$concat) |&gt;\n  select(Geography, `Estimate (%)`, concat_wrap) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = Geography, names_from = \"concat_wrap\",\n              values_from = \"Estimate (%)\")\n\n# Pregnancy - pregnant is not available at the state level during the filtered timeframe\nstate_not_in_top_10 &lt;- top_10_highest_hesitance_cat_list |&gt;\n  filter(!concat %in% state_group_analysis$concat)\n\npregnancy_check &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Group Category` == \"Pregnant\") |&gt;\n  distinct(`Geography Type`, Geography, `Group Name`, `Group Category`,\n           `Time Period`, Year)\n\n# Identify top most hesitant states\ntop_10_hesistant_states &lt;- covid_2021_analysis_allstates |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(`Estimate (%)`)) |&gt;\n  filter(!Geography %in% c(\"Guam\",\"Puerto Rico\")) |&gt;\n  slice(1:10)\n  \n# Identify top least hesitant states\nbottom_10_hesistant_states &lt;- covid_2021_analysis_allstates |&gt;\n  arrange(`Estimate (%)`)|&gt;\n  filter(!Geography %in% c(\"Guam\",\"Puerto Rico\")) |&gt;\n  slice(1:10)\n\n# Filter pivoted data on most hesitant states\ntop_10_parallel_analaysis &lt;- state_group_analysis_pivot |&gt;\n  filter(Geography %in% top_10_hesistant_states$Geography)\n\n\n# Display parallel coordinates plot for most hesitant states\nggparcoord(top_10_parallel_analaysis |&gt; select(where(~!any(is.na(.)))), columns = c(2:8),\n           scale = \"globalminmax\",\n           alpha = 0.4) +\n  labs(title = \"2021 Hesitance Rates by Population Segment\",\n       subtitle = \"10 Highest Hesitance States\",\n       x = \"Population Segments\", y = \"2021 Hesitance (%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter pivoted data on least hesitant states\nbottom_10_parallel_analaysis &lt;- state_group_analysis_pivot |&gt;\n  filter(Geography %in% bottom_10_hesistant_states$Geography)\n\n\n# Display parallel coordinates plot for least hesitant states\nggparcoord(bottom_10_parallel_analaysis |&gt; select(where(~!any(is.na(.)))), \n           columns = c(2:7),   \n           scale = \"globalminmax\",\n           alpha = 0.4) +\n    labs(title = \"2021 Hesitance Rates by Population Segment\",\n    subtitle = \"10 Lowest Hesitance States\",\n    x = \"Population Segments\", y = \"2021 Hesitance (%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the hesitance rates within states were not uniform across all population segments. In particular, the group of individuals who responded “A little or not at all” to whether vaccination is important to them showed remarkably higher hesitance rates at the state level, which held true for every state.\nThis observation suggests that vaccine hesitance may not differ solely based on geography and ties in closely with the key question we posed in our research plan: are certain types of demographics more strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitance than others? To address this question, we proceeded to conduct Chi-Squared tests at the national level for every demographic specified in the Data section of this report. Based on the statistical significance of each test, we then ranked the demographics to identify those that had a stronger association with COVID-19 vaccine hesitance.\n\n\nCode\n# Define function to run Chi Square test for a given demographic\nget_chi_sq &lt;- function(df, geography, time_period, year, group_name, hesitant_group) {\n  \n  temp &lt;- df |&gt; filter(Geography == geography,\n                       `Indicator Name`== \"Vaccination uptake and intention\",\n                       `Time Period` == time_period,\n                       Year == year,\n                       `Group Name`== group_name) |&gt;\n    mutate(hesitant = ifelse(`Indicator Category` %in% hesitant_group,1,0)) |&gt;\n    group_by(`Group Category`,hesitant) |&gt;\n    summarise(hesitance_rate = sum(`Estimate (%)`),\n              sample_size = first(`Sample Size`)) |&gt;\n    mutate(n_hesitance = round(hesitance_rate/100 * sample_size,0)) |&gt;\n    filter(hesitant == 1) |&gt;\n    select(`Group Category`,n_hesitance,sample_size)\n  \n  if(nrow(temp) &gt; 0) {\n    expected_proportion &lt;- sum(temp$n_hesitance)/sum(temp$sample_size)\n\n  temp &lt;- temp |&gt;\n    mutate(expected = sample_size*expected_proportion)\n  \n  res = chisq.test(x = temp$n_hesitance, p = temp$expected/sum(temp$expected))\n  output &lt;- list(round(res$statistic,digits = 0), res$p.value)\n    \n  }\n  else {\n    output &lt;- list(0,0)\n    \n  }\n  \n  \n   return(output)\n}\n\ngroup_name_toloop &lt;- c(\"Sex\", \"Age\", \"Race/Ethnicity (7 level)\",\n                       \"Age by race/ethnicity\", \"Sexual orientation\",\n                       \"Gender identity\", \"Metropolitan statistical area\",\n                       \"Born in the U.S.\", \"Language of interview\",\n                       \"Poverty status\", \"Insurance status\",\n                       \"Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) of county of residence\",\n                       \"Political leaning of county of residence\",\n                       \"Received non-COVID-19 vaccine(s) in past two years\",\n                       \"Health condition associated with higher risk for COVID-19 (any)\",\n                       \"Disability status (any)\",\n                       \"Pregnancy status (females age 18 – 49 years)\",\n                       \"Ever had COVID-19 disease (self-report)\",\n                       \"Concern about getting COVID-19 disease\",\n                       \"Confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety\",\n                       \"Confidence that COVID-19 vaccine is important\",\n                       \"Healthcare provider recommended I get a COVID-19 vaccine\",\n                       \"COVID-19 vaccination status of friends and family\",\n                       \"Work or school requires COVID-19 vaccination\" )\n\ngroup_name_toloop_short &lt;- lapply(group_name_toloop, function(x) ifelse(x %in% names(group_name_shortening), group_name_shortening[[x]], x))\n  \n\nresult_df2 &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 3, nrow = 0))\ncolnames(result_df2) &lt;- c(\"group_name\", \"X2_test_stat\", \"p_value\")\n\nfor (x in group_name_toloop_short) {\n  res &lt;- get_chi_sq(covid_2021_analysis,geography = \"National\",\n                    time_period = \"2021 analysis period\",\n                    year = 2021,\n                    group_name = x,\n                    hesitant_group = c(\"Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated\"))\n  result_df2[nrow(result_df2) + 1,] = c(x,res[1],res[2])\n\n}\n\nresult_df2 &lt;- arrange(result_df2, desc(X2_test_stat))\n\nresult_df2 |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  top_n(10,X2_test_stat) |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(`Demographic Type` = group_name)\n\n\n    Demographic Type X2_test_stat p_value\n1    Vaccine.Imprtnt        78443       0\n2   Vaccine.Confiden        45851       0\n3       Fr.Fam.Vaccd        33687       0\n4        Past.Vaccin        12886       0\n5      Covid.Concern         7882       0\n6           Age.Race         6893       0\n7                Age         5585       0\n8          Political         4616       0\n9        Work.School         3969       0\n10 Dr.Recommend.Vacc         3823       0\n\n\nThe top 10 most statistically significant types of demographics are displayed above. These results provide key insights into understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitance, such as:\n\nWhether an individual has been vaccinated in the past may determine their hesitance toward the COVID-19 vaccine (see Chi-Squared for “Past.Vaccin”).\nOne’s age and race may also influence hesitance (see “Age.Race” above). We previously saw that white individuals between the ages of 18-49 were more hesitant than others.\nMoreover, whether an individual associates themselves with the Republican party could also impact willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (see Chi-Squared “Political”).\n\nTwo illustrative mosaic plots are shown below to confirm the Chi-Square test results above. The first plot helps visualize the relationship between COVID-19 vaccine hesitance vs the self-perceived importance of vaccines in general (the group with the highest Chi-Square score). The second plot visualizes the association between hesitance and gender identity (the group with the lowest Chi-Square score).\n\n\nCode\nmosaic_2var &lt;- function(df,indep_var_group_name,n_chars) {\n  truncate_string &lt;- function(x) {\n  str_sub(x, 1, n_chars)}\n\nindep_var_group_name_no_spaces &lt;- gsub(\"[()\\\\[/\\\\\\\\ ]\", \".\", indep_var_group_name)\nindep_var_group_name_no_spaces &lt;- truncate_string(indep_var_group_name_no_spaces)\n\ntemp &lt;- df |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(`Group Name` == indep_var_group_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_not_hesitant = `Sample Size` - n_hesitant) |&gt;\n  select(`Group Category`, n_hesitant, n_not_hesitant,`Sample Size`) |&gt;\n  rename(!!indep_var_group_name_no_spaces := `Group Category`,\n         hesitant = `n_hesitant`,\n         `not hesitant` = n_not_hesitant) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = hesitant:`not hesitant`,names_to = \"group\", values_to = \"Freq\")\n\n\ntemp[[indep_var_group_name_no_spaces]] =  substr(temp[[indep_var_group_name_no_spaces]], 1, n_chars)\n\n\nformula &lt;- as.formula(paste(\"group\", \"~\", indep_var_group_name_no_spaces))\n\n\n\nreturn(mosaic(formula, direction = c(\"v\", \"h\"), temp,\n       highlighting_fill = c(\"grey80\", \"cornflowerblue\"),\n       gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 10, fontface = 1),\n       gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 6)))\n\n}\n\nmosaic_2var(covid_2021_analysis,\"Vaccine.Imprtnt\", 100)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmosaic_2var(covid_2021_analysis,\"G.Identity\", 100)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen in the first plot that those who consider vaccines as important had significantly lower hesitance than those who did not. On the other hand, gender identity yielded a plot that exactly matches a mosaic plot of expected values, thus confirming its statistically insignificant Chi-Square test result.\nWhile mosaic plots can be analyzed for every type of demographic, having the list of most statistically significant groups is beneficial on its own for furthering our exploration of vaccine hesitance. For instance, the significant results we obtained may spark an interest in researching how race affected hesitance in 2021. We can also begin to research the influence of being U.S. born or living in a rural community on hesitance, as both these categories of demographics had a statistically significant Chi-Squared.\nNow that we have a better understanding of the relationships between geography, demographics, and 2021 COVID-19 vaccine hesitance, we will move onto the second part of our research, which looks at how vaccine hesitance has changed over time."

    "text": "3.2 Part 2: Analysis of segments that showed the greatest reduction in COVID vaccine hesitancy between 2021 and 2023\nAcross the nation, vaccine hesitance declined from around 18% in April/May 2021 to 11% in May/June 2023, as shown in the previously-seen graph below.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for the vaccination uptake and intent indicator\n# Filter for responses corresponding to vaccine hesitancy\n# Include all adults 18+\n# Set time period to monthly (excluding weekly samples) and filter for nationwide samples\nvacc_intention_time &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Indicator Name` == 'Vaccination uptake and intention') |&gt;\n  filter(`Indicator Category` == 'Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated') |&gt;\n  filter(`Group Name` == 'All adults 18+') |&gt;\n  filter(`Time Type` == 'Monthly') |&gt;\n  filter(Geography == 'National') |&gt;\n  arrange(`Geography Type`, Geography, `Time Period`)\n\n# Derive month of data collection\nvacc_intention_time &lt;- vacc_intention_time |&gt;\n  mutate(month_split = paste0(str_split(`Time Period`, \"-\",\n                                        simplify = TRUE)[, 2],\n         \", \", Year),\n         month = mdy(month_split))\n\n# Plot hesitancy over time\nggplot(vacc_intention_time, aes(x = month, y = `Estimate (%)`,\n                                color = `Indicator Category`)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"U.S. Vaccination Response Rates Over Time\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Response Rate (%)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(title = \"Indicator Category:\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some segments of the population demonstrated a greater decline in hesitance than others. To better understand population-specific changes in hesitance, we developed the following cleveland dot plot, which breaks down vaccine hesitance for 20 population segments that had the highest initial hesitance 2021.\n\n\nCode\nannual_monthly_snapshots = c(\"April 22 - May 29\",\"May 1 - May 28\",\n                             \"April 30 - May 27\")\n\nsnapshots &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Time Period` %in% annual_monthly_snapshots,\n         `Group Name` %in% group_name_toloop,\n         Geography == \"National\",\n         `Indicator Category` == \"Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated\" ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = as.factor(Year)) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(`Group Name`), ~recode(., !!!group_name_shortening)) |&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(`Group Category`), ~recode(., !!!group_cat_shortening)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rows = paste(`Group Name`, `Group Category`, sep = \" - \")) |&gt;\n  select(rows,Year,`Estimate (%)`) |&gt;\n  arrange(rows, Year) \n\nrow_order &lt;- snapshots |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = `Estimate (%)`) |&gt;\n  drop_na(`2021`) |&gt;\n  drop_na(`2023`) |&gt;\n  mutate(decline_21_23 = `2021` - `2023`) |&gt;\n  arrange((decline_21_23))\n\nrow_order_list_chg_21_23 &lt;- c(row_order$rows)\n\nrow_order_list_2021 &lt;- row_order |&gt;\n  arrange(`2021`) |&gt;\n  top_n(20,`2021`) |&gt;\n  select(rows)\n\nrow_order_list_2021 &lt;- row_order_list_2021$rows               \n\nrow_order_list_2023 &lt;- c(row_order |&gt;\n                           arrange((`2023`)) |&gt;\n                           select(rows))\n\nsnapshots &lt;- snapshots[snapshots$rows %in% row_order_list_chg_21_23, ]\n\n\nsnapshots |&gt; filter(rows %in% row_order_list_2021) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = `Estimate (%)`, y = fct_relevel(rows,(row_order_list_2021)),\n             color = Year)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"20 Most Hesitant Segments in 2021, and Changes in 2022-23\",\n       x = \"Vaccine hesitance (%)\", y = \"Population Segments\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6), plot.title = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen from the cleveland dot plot that the change in hesitance of the top 20 most hesitant segments in 2021 varies by population segment. To visualize this change better, we also created the bar graph below, which shows the 10 segments that demonstrated the largest decreases in hesitance between 2021 and 2023.\n\n\nCode\n# Bar chart of changes\n\nrow_order$rows &lt;- str_wrap(row_order$rows, width = 10)\n\nrow_order |&gt;\n  top_n(10, decline_21_23) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(rows,rev(decline_21_23)), y = decline_21_23)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"navy\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Segments with the Largest 2021-23 Decreases\",\n       x = \"Population Segments\", y = \"2021-23 % Decrease in Hesitance\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 1, hjust=0.5,size=6),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size=8),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Uncomment code below to view dataframe of combinations of state and population segments that had large increases or decreases in hesitance\n\n# covid_hes_prepped &lt;- covid_hes_prepped |&gt;\n#   mutate(month_split = paste0(str_split(`Time Period`, \"-\",\n#                                         simplify = TRUE)[, 2],\n#          \", \", Year),\n#          month = mdy(month_split))\n# \n# \n# state_group &lt;- covid_hes_prepped |&gt;\n#   filter(`Geography Type` == \"Jurisdictional Estimates\",\n#          !grepl(\"-\", Geography)) |&gt;\n#   mutate(n_hesitant = round(`Estimate (%)`/100 * `Sample Size`, 0)) |&gt;\n#   group_by(Geography, `Group Name`, `Group Category`, `Time Period`, Year,\n#            concat, concat_wrap, month) |&gt;\n#   summarise(`Sample Size` = sum(`Sample Size`),\n#             n_hesitant = sum(n_hesitant)) |&gt;\n#   mutate(`Estimate (%)` = n_hesitant / `Sample Size` * 100) |&gt;\n#   ungroup() |&gt;\n#   group_by(Geography, `Group Name`, `Group Category`, concat) |&gt;\n#   mutate(min_month = min(month),\n#          min_year = year(min_month),\n#          max_month = max(month),\n#          max_year = year(max_month)) |&gt;\n#   filter(month == min_month | month == max_month) |&gt;\n#   filter(!min_year == max_year) |&gt;\n#   ungroup()\n# \n# \n# state_group_pivot &lt;- state_group |&gt;\n#   pivot_wider(id_cols = c(Geography, concat), names_from = \"Year\", values_from = `Estimate (%)`)\n# \n# state_group_pivot &lt;- state_group_pivot |&gt;\n#   filter(!(`2023` == \"NULL\" | `2021` == \"NULL\")) |&gt;\n#   mutate(delta = as.numeric(`2023`) - as.numeric(`2021`))\n\n\nThe bar chart shows that individuals who did not perceive vaccines as essential had the sharpest decline in hesitance. Other groups who also had large decreases are those who had low confidence in vaccine safety/efficacy and those who contracted COVID.\nWhile more research is required to understand why some of these segments had more substantial decreases in hesitance, we can analyze whether initial hesitance in 2021 is an associated factor. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between hesitance rates in 2021 and the change in hesitance from 2021-23 across population segments.\n\n\nCode\nrow_order %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = `2021`, y = decline_21_23)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") + \n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of 2021 hesitance vs. 2021-23 decline by population segment\",\n       x = \"2021 Hesitance (%)\",\n       y = \"Decline in hesitance (2021-23) (%)\")+\n  stat_poly_eq(formula = y ~ x,   # Add R-squared value\n               aes(label = paste( ..rr.label.., sep = \"~~~~\")),\n               parse = TRUE,\n               size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\nSegments with the highest initial hesitance generally showed the greatest reduction in hesitance, with a high R2 of 0.75. This could be because those with the highest hesitance received targeted public healthcare interventions, or simply because they had the greatest scope for reduction in the first place. Determining the exact reason requires further investigation that is beyond the scope of this project.\nSimilar to Part 1 of our analysis, we are also interested in understanding changes in hesitance by geography. To answer this question, we constructed the following heatmap of changes in hesitance by state.\n\n\nCode\ncomparison_baseline_2021 &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Year` == 2021, `Time Type` == \"Monthly\",\n         `Time Period` == \"April 22 - May 29\",\n         `Group Category`== \"All adults age 18+ years\",\n         `Geography Type` %in% c(\"Jurisdictional Estimates\"),\n         `Indicator Category` == \"Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated\",\n         !grepl(\"-\", Geography)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_hesitant = round(`Estimate (%)`/100 * `Sample Size`, 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Geography) |&gt;\n  summarise(`Sample Size` = sum(`Sample Size`),\n            n_hesitant = sum(n_hesitant)) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Estimate (%)` = n_hesitant / `Sample Size` * 100,\n         `Time Period` = \"2021 most recent snapshot\",\n         Year = 2021)\n\ncovid_2023_analysis_allstates &lt;- covid |&gt;\n  filter(`Year` == 2023, `Time Type` == \"Monthly\",\n         `Time Period` == \"May 28 - June 30\",\n         `Group Category`== \"All adults age 18+ years\",\n         `Geography Type` %in% c(\"Jurisdictional Estimates\"),\n         `Indicator Category` == \"Probably or definitely will not get vaccinated\",\n         !grepl(\"-\", Geography)) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_hesitant = round(`Estimate (%)`/100 * `Sample Size`, 0)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Geography) |&gt;\n  summarise(`Sample Size` = sum(`Sample Size`),\n            n_hesitant = sum(n_hesitant)) |&gt;\n  mutate(`Estimate (%)` = n_hesitant / `Sample Size` * 100,\n         `Time Period` = \"2023 most recent snapshot\",\n         Year = 2023)\n\n\nstate_delta &lt;- left_join(covid_2023_analysis_allstates,\n                         comparison_baseline_2021 |&gt;\n                           select(Geography, estimate_2021 = `Estimate (%)`),\n                         by = \"Geography\")\n\nstate_delta &lt;- state_delta |&gt;\n  mutate(`Change in Hesitancy Rates` = `Estimate (%)` - estimate_2021)\n\nstate_delta_map &lt;- state_delta |&gt;\n  select(Geography, `Change in Hesitancy Rates`) |&gt;\n  transmute(region = tolower(Geography),\n            value = as.numeric(`Change in Hesitancy Rates`))\n\n\n# red_green_palette &lt;- brewer.pal(n = 7, name = \"RdYlGn\")\n\nstate_choropleth(state_delta_map,\n                 title = \"   2021-2023 Changes in Vaccine Hesitance by State\",\n                 legend = \"Change in \\nHesitancy Rates   \",\n                 num_colors = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap indicates that West Virginia exhibited the greatest overall change in hesitance (-23.3%). Other geographies that had higher hesitance rates in 2021, such as the South East and Northern Mountain West, also had more notable decreases in hesitance. Conversely, some states had almost no change in hesitance. New Mexico, in particular, experienced a slight increase in hesitance of 0.3%.\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship between initial hesitance in 2021 and the change in hesitance between 2021-23 by state.\n\n\nCode\nstate_delta %&gt;% mutate(`Decline in Hesitancy Rates` = -1*`Change in Hesitancy Rates`) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = estimate_2021, y = `Decline in Hesitancy Rates`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") + \n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of 2021 Hesitance vs. 2021-23 Decline by State\",\n       x = \"2021 Hesitance (%)\",\n       y = \"2021-23 Decline in Hesitance (%)\")+\n  stat_poly_eq(formula = y ~ x,   # Add R-squared value\n               aes(label = paste( ..rr.label.., sep = \"~~~~\")),\n               parse = TRUE,\n               size = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the heatmap, states with the highest initial hesitance generally showed the greatest decline in hesitance; although, the R-Squared statistic is low (0.15). This relationship is significantly weaker than a similar relationship seen for population segments where the R-Squared was 0.75.\nTo view the latest distribution of vaccine hesitance by state, we produced one additional heatmap of statewide hesitance rates as of June 30th, 2023.\n\n\nCode\n# Prep dataframe to be used in the state_choropleth function\ncovid_2023_analysis_allstates_map &lt;- covid_2023_analysis_allstates |&gt;\n  select(Geography, `Estimate (%)`) |&gt;\n  transmute(region = tolower(Geography), value = `Estimate (%)`)\n\n\n# Display state heatmap of hesitance rates\nstate_choropleth(covid_2023_analysis_allstates_map,\n                 title = \"   June 2023 COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitance Rates by State\",\n                 legend = \"Hesitancy Rates (%) \")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map shows vaccine hesitance is still prevalent in some states, namely in southern states, as well as Wyoming, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio.\nIn the following section, we summarize our takeaways from Part 1 as well as the time series analysis from Part 2."

    "text": "3.3 Part 3: High-level recommendations for segments of the population that need further public health interventions.\nOur analyses highlighted several key findings:\n\nIn 2021, COVID-19 vaccine hesitance was present in all states and many segments of the population. However, some regions and groups were more susceptible to hesitance, as seen by the disparities in hesitance rates between states and population segments.\nSome differences between population demographics may have been drivers of vaccine hesitance in 2021. For example, population characteristics such as one’s perception of the importance, safety, and efficacy of vaccines or having unvaccinated friends and family appear to be linked with hesitancy. We recommend further analysis into how someone’s willingness to receive the COVID vaccine may be impacted by the following characteristics:\n\n\nGeneral perception of vaccination importance\nPast history of vaccination\nRace/ethnicity\nPolitical views\nLiving in a rural vs urban community\nBeing U.S. Born or not\n\n\nThree years after the beginning of the pandemic, vaccine hesitance persists in most states and some segments of the populations. However, hesitance can be reduced. There was a history of successful reductions in hesitance between 2021-23 nationally (-7%), state-wise (up to -23%), and by population segment (up to -32%). This was especially visible in states like West Virginia, and segments such as those who had reservations about the importance or the safety and efficacy of vaccines. This indicates potential to further reduce hesitance in these segments; although, further study into the causes of these declines in hesitance is required. As of June 2023, the geographies and population segments listed below exhibit the largest hesitance. In the event that future COVID outbreaks were to occur, we recommend prioritizing outreach to these groups to reduce hesitance and mitigate further spread of the disease.\n\n\nResidents of states with high hesitance rates: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio\nIndividuals who have not been previously vaccinated\nIndividuals who are not insured\nWomen who are pregnant and have not been vaccinated\nIndividuals who are white and between the age of 18 and 49\nIndividuals living in rural communities\n\nAdditional trends in vaccination hesitance over time may exist. In the following section of this report, we provide a tool that visualizes month-by-month hesitance by state and population segment.\n\n\nCode\n# # Uncomment the code below to create inputs files to interactive D3 graphic\n# \n# \n# hesitance_state_group_cat &lt;- covid_hes_prepped |&gt;\n#   filter(`Geography Type` %in% c(\"Jurisdictional Estimates\"),\n#          !grepl(\"-\", Geography)) |&gt;\n#   mutate(month_split = paste0(str_split(`Time Period`, \"-\",\n#                                         simplify = TRUE)[, 2], \", \", Year),\n#          month = mdy(month_split),\n#          n_hesitant = round(`Estimate (%)`/100 * `Sample Size`, 0)) |&gt;\n#   group_by(Geography, `Group Name`, `Group Category`, concat, month) |&gt;\n#   summarise(`Sample Size` = sum(`Sample Size`),\n#             n_hesitant = sum(n_hesitant)) |&gt;\n#   mutate(`Estimate (%)` = n_hesitant / `Sample Size` * 100,\n#          concat_no_state = concat,\n#          concat = paste0(Geography, \": \", concat)) |&gt;\n#   ungroup()\n# \n# \n# d3_input_prep &lt;- hesitance_state_group_cat |&gt;\n#   pivot_wider(id_cols = month, names_from = \"concat\", values_from = `Estimate (%)`) |&gt;\n#   dplyr::rename(Category = month)\n# \n# d3_input_prep[is.na(d3_input_prep)] &lt;- 0\n# \n# \n# write_csv(d3_input_prep, \"D3 Inputs/All State-Category Values.csv\")\n# \n# \n# dropdown_selections &lt;- hesitance_state_group_cat |&gt;\n#   distinct(Geography, concat_no_state)\n# \n# write_csv(dropdown_selections, \"D3 Inputs/Dropdown Choices.csv\")"

    "text": "The graph below visualizes COVID-19 vaccine hesitance rates for each state and population segment from 2021 to 2023. It is intended to compare how hesitancy within different geographies and population segments evolved over time.\n\n\nLegend\n\n\nSelect State 1:  Select Category 1: \n\n\nSelect State 2:  Select Category 2: \n\n\n\n\nThe following selections help illustrate some of the key findings discussed in the Results section of this report:\n\n\n\nState 1: Oklahoma, Category 1: Age - 50 – 64\nState 2: West Virginia, Category 2: Insurance - Not insured OR\nState 2: Utah, Category 2: SVI - Moderate\n\n\nThe combinations above illustrate some of the remarkable disparities in how vaccine hesitance changed across geographies and population segments. Individuals between the ages 50 to 64 in Oklahoma saw a 14% increase in hesitance over the two years. On the other hand, West Virginia residents who are not insured had a 31% drop in hesitance, while Utah residents who qualified as “moderate” in the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) also had a large decrease of 30% in hesitance.\nThe disparities can also be seen within a given state. For instance, the selection below illustrates how two population segments in Texas, individuals with a disability and essential frontline workers, had very different trends in hesitance.\n\n\nState 1: Texas, Category 1: Disability - Yes\nState 2: Texas, Category 2: Ess.Wrkr.grp - Frontline.Other\n\n\nLastly, the grouped bar chart also revealed that disparities in hesitance change can also occur within the same population segment. The selection below shows that individuals New Mexico between the age of 50 and 64 had a 16% increase in hesitance, whereas the same group had a 21% decrease in hesitance in Mississippi.\n\n\nState 1: New Mexico, Category 1: Age.Race - 50 – 64, White\nState 2: Mississippi, Category 2: Age.Race - 50 – 64, White\n\n\nWe leave it up to the reader to explore differences in trends from other combinations of geographies and population segments."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitance was an obstacle in the global response to the virus. Given the extended length and severity of the pandemic, as well as the possibility of future outbreaks, we decided to investigate COVID-19 vaccine hesitance rates in the U.S. to identify patterns in hesitance and potential interventions for public healthcare professionals to lessen the impact of future pandemics.\nOur investigation into vaccine hesitance rates revealed the complexities of achieving widespread conformity with regard to public health guidelines. While hesitance is not entirely isolated to a specific handful of groups within the U.S., the data allowed us to develop recommendations for structuring effective outreach to the geographies and populations that continue to exhibit hesitance despite nearly three years of global experience with COVID vaccines. Prioritizing outreach to the following population segments that exhibited high hesitance may be effective in reducing hesitance:\n\nSegments that felt vaccines were unimportant\nSegments that felt vaccines were unsafe or ineffective\nSegments where friends and family were not vaccinated\n\nSimilarly, prioritizing outreach to individuals within states such as Oklahoma, Indiana, and Texas could yield more significant reductions in hesitance relative to geographies that have historically supported vaccination.\nOur research showed encouraging signs that, in the right conditions, vaccine hesitance can be reduced over time. While national hesitance declined from about 18% in 2021 to around 11% in May/June 2023, several geographies and population segments showed even more sizable decreases in hesitance since 2021 than the national average - a maximum decline of up to 32% has been recorded for some population segments.\nFurther research into the reasons behind some geographic regions and population segments exhibiting above-average declines in hesitance may help public health professionals understand strategies to reduce hesitance in geographic areas and population segments exhibiting below-average declines. With this further research, vaccine hesitance in the U.S. (and possibly globally) can be reduced, improving global public health and economic resilience in future pandemics."
